In no particular order, here's a (probably incomplete) list of things
I want to add to fwx.

Add a version field to the data written to the CSV file. 
Done v0.4

Remove all derived data (faked wind gust & dew point) from the CSV 
file. (maybe)

Provide a program which will read the CSV file, compute non-measured 
data, and write a separate CSV file out with more complete data. 

Add all the other data provided by the VP in the LOOP packet to the 
CSV file, currently I only log what the sensors in the default VP 
package provide (no solar radiation, UV, leaf & soil wetness, etc). 

Add LOOP2 data

Fire off a separate thread or process to run the LOOP command with a 
large count and write the data to a shared memory segment.  A second 
thread will then periodically read the data, validate it, and log it. 
Tried this for v0.4, decided it was not the right aproach

Periodically set the Vantage Pro's clock to the PC's clock. 

Provide a command to read and write config & calibration factors from VP.

Provide some scripts which process the CSV files and prepare input to
gnuplot (or some other graphing package). 

Add a configuration file with default values for things like log
files, sample rates, serial port, WU login info, etc...
